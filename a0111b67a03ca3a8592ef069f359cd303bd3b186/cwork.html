				 Mobile app that facilitates staff resourcing in over 1000 branches in Australia 
			</span>
			<p> 
				<b> Background: </b>Thousand of staff in over hundred of branches nationally. Frequent requests for personal, vacation and sick leave impacts our ability to service customers. We designed a mobile app that gives managers the ability to tap the whole CommBank network to find a CBA staff to work in their branch.
			</p>
			<p> 
				Finding a suitable replacement when staff were sick or needed time off proved difficult - CommBank needed a better way to allocate and track adhoc shifts.
			</p>
			<p> 
				We spoke with branch managers to understand their day to day and a recurring theme began to emerge where the team would absorb the extra work, which consequently impacted the level of service and wait times at our locations.

			<h3> Design themes </h3>
			<h4 class=""> Design theme 1: time critical feedback </h4>
			<p> 
				Our branch managers are effective multi-taskers, often triaging customers, supporting their staff with complex loan queries and completing reports. They really had no time to initiate and broker shifts from potentially available staff members in the area through ways of phone call or text message. This is why our app kept them informed and up to date as a single shift progresses through several permutations over the course of a single working day â€” our system effectively keeps both the managers and staff in a feedback cycle.

			<h4 class=""> Design theme 2: simplifying the information architecture</h4>
			<p> 
				As we worked through several iterations of the design. We noticed our IA becoming convoluted and chaotic as a result of designing our states in isolation of a system. When we thought about the states in context of the user, a simplified theme sorted by 'urgency or action' made the most sense. This meant eliminating several other colours like 'red' for decline and 'grey' for inactive.
