			<h2> One central system for all IAG products and services </h2>
			<p> 
				IAG is undergoing a digital transformation project that leverages a single system to unite all of IAG brands and products into a central system. This strategic manoeuvre unlocks IAG’s ability to launch new insurance products at speed, and maintain all polices under a central Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform for an omni-channel digital and assisted experience.

			<h3> 
				The first 2 months were about understanding the product, underwriting and the levers customers pay attention to when they are interacting with the service.
			</h3>
			<p> 
				As someone that considers themselves financially savvy – I found it difficult to understand the underlying details and coverages the product offers and how these coverages are sectioned into categories that had differing inclusions and exclusions. We wrote the content as an educational piece that seeks to teach insurance literacy for new users and also help power-users understand and balance the levers of the price, risk and coverages.

			<h3> 
				We analysed the paths that would be the most disruptive for the customer. It's almost as if everything else hinged on a few questions in the flow, so we brought these questions upfront.
			</h3>
			<p>
				By asking customers to tell us the <u>'property type'</u> and <u>'who lives in this property'</u> before the app starts. We are able to pre-qualify customers or send them off to more relevant products even before the quote app is initiated. This optimisation allows the business to effectively triage customers and also save customers from answering a set of questions only to realise they've selected the wrong product.

			<span class="subtitle"> The exceptions (negative paths) </span>
			<h3> 
				9 unique types of exceptions can execute all at the same time in the worst-case scenario. 
			</h3>
			<p> 
				We approached this problem by modelling the edge-cases and working backwards to create a flexible system that priorities customers/business needs. This includes everything from when we hand off to a call centre consultant when an underwriting override is needed to proceed, when we refer to another IAG product and how we communicate policy exclusions anywhere within the quote funnel. 
			</p>
			<p>
				By creating an <b>exception hierarchy, </b> we are able to prioritise and serve up exceptions in a considered manner. This can be observed by how we prioritise clearing input validation before executing service calls, when customers are referred to a call centre or a cross product referal and when geographic exclusions that affect your property become active as you're

			<span class="subtitle"> Policy variations and consent capture  </span>
			<h3> 
				Variations to policies may also be applied retrospectively in a 24/7 window. We designed a dynamic system to cater for geographic exclusions caused by natural disasters like bushfires, storms, floods, tsunamis and pandemics. 
			</h3>
			<p> 
				These system events need to be communicated and accepted by the customer. In our approach we wanted to warn customers of exclusion as soon as they provided us with their address in step 1. <u>The challenge </u>was that the initial acceptance could be invalid by the time the customer reaches the payments pages where a variance in exclusions are applied by the business at anytime in the day. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>The most obvious solution </b>is to capture consent at the very last moment on the 'Purchase policy' call to action. The problem with this method was that this created additional friction when finalising the sale which impacts heavily on the business and annoyance for the customer. Instead, we ask all customers to accept the policy variation terms before loading the final payments page so the chances of seeing policy variations after customers select 'Purchase policy' is reduced to less than 1%.

			<span class="subtitle"> Introducing 3rd party data </span>
			<h3> 
				By leveraging CoreLogic’s property data service, we are able to pre-fill a large majority of address searches.
			</h3>
			<p> 
				When the details of the user’s home are populated into the system and onto their screen – users felt a sense of paranoia about the system knowing intimate details about their property. This prompted us to make changes to explain who CoreLogic are and how we use this data to make sure the assets on the policy are accurate and communicate the benefits of having property details pre-filled.

			<h3> 
				The contents insurance product model is convoluted. The challenge was untangling the complexities for everyday users to understand. This meant we need to be absolutely clear of the inclusions, what you can claim against and communicating and balancing the totals. 
			</h3>
			<p> 
				We tested this design with users and it excelled in providing clarity to a complex product. All users were able to complete the task of explaining the inclusions, the differences between the different types of coverages and adding additional coverage to the categories. <br><br>A high level breakdown of the designs below:

			<h3> 
				Across all our brands and products. There isn’t a single way uniform way to ‘Add’ items to a list. There was an opportunity to develop a single pattern that could be scaled and flexible enough to capture everything from driver information, owners of the assets, finance providers, travel destinations and more..
			</h3>
			<p> 
				We scaled this design to all our Home, Landlord, Motor, Strata and Travel Insurance products. We developed these patterns in conjunction with the accessibility and development team which essentially resulted in allowing other teams to implement this model and inherit the AA accessibility component rating and our validation framework.
