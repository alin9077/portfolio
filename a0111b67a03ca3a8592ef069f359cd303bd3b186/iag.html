				IAG is embarking on a multi-year digital transformation program to consolidate all of its brands and products including NRMA onto a single omni-channel platform. The programâ€™s strategic goal is to streamline products by sharing common foundations, underwriting and design across its vast array of products and brand.
			</p>
			<p> 
				By starting from scratch, the opportunity to establish design standards that are uniform, flexible and scalable across the entire ecosystem was evident. As a result, our success in designing, testing and deploying common patterns and interaction models has allowed us bring new products online exponentially faster through each iteration.

				<b> Above: </b>Unhappy paths that exists across all our products

				<b> Policy decline: </b> We only insure assets that are well maintained and we may offer more suitable products depending on how customers answer our questions.
			</p>
			<p> 
				<b> Refer to call centre: </b> All customers are different and their needs are always dependent on their risk appetite, budget and understanding of policy inclusions. A handful of individuals may only want insurance to tick a box or insure their asset for 40% of it's value, others may want to insure their assets for a value far above our estimates.
			</p>
			<p> 
				<b> Storm, flood and fire exclusions added (embargoes): </b> Natural peril events may occur at any hour of the day. We need to be able to alert and capture policy exclusion consent from customers.

				<b> Data collection (one or many items): </b> Underwriting and insurance products naturally require a copious amounts of personal data which is then used to price premiums and risk. We developed this pattern to be used for all our products company-wide. We also needed to meet our stringent accessibility requirements where we discovered challenges in breaking our onNext page validation convention and introducing onBlur input validation which resulted in a robust technical implementation that handled corner cases like keeping our error validation list synchronised when items were removed and how we focussed screenreaders when changes are made.
